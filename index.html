                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    The are.na link with all of my research and sketches is <a href="https://www.are.na/share/abvCpxj">here</a>. My assigned interation was Duration. After doing some research and looking through the websites on <a href="https://sundaysites.cafe/">Sunday Sites</a>, I came up with my original concept for this assignment, which was to do a sort of time-lapse interaction with moon phases. I created some sketches but I quickly realized that even though it was a cool visual, it wasn't really interactive. So I switched gears a bit and took inspiration from one website that made use of various shapes spinning on a blank background. I sketched out some colourful glowing orbs that I wasn't sure what I would do with yet. I decided to test it out in code and animated them bouncing but I ran into the same problem as before where there was no interactivity.

                <h2>Sketches/Prototypes</h2>
                <p>
                    After I started drafting my floating-orbs idea and realized it was not very engaging, I added more interactions to it, like hover effects and some Javascript. My original plan was to have different interactions that you could reach by navigating from a homepage. But again, I didn't think it really showcased my interaction of Duration and it was a bit boring. During critique, I recieved feedback about maybe incorporating more time based interaction like different colours and interactions based on time of day or week. I really liked this idea so I kind of ran with it for my next iteration.

                <p>
                    Once I decided to work with the time-based change interactions for my website I did some more research for how to achieve my goals. I basically wanted to keep a lot of the coding work I had already done as I had already made 3 pages of different interactions, so I decided that based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night) the page would change to a different interaction and colour. I also added a clock to time when you arrive to the site. My goal was to create a calming experience that was designed to keep you there for a little while. I added an alert at the start welcoming visitors and encouraging them to stay a while and check back later since it would change. I also added a clock in the corner to clock in when you arrived, just as another time based interaction and to let people see how long they've been on. It doesn't track how long you stay on, only says when you arrive, because I thought if it were like a timer it might be stressful to watch time pass. This way they can see how long they were there by comparing the "punch in" to the current time.

                <p>
                  After the critique of the pervious version of my website, I made some more changes. The things I was going to add from critique were changing the alert style to match the page more, changing the arrival time thing to maybe signify the arrival of something else rather than arrival to the website, change location of the bubbles for each page, add a visit count, change some language used, and add more popup alerts the longer you spend. Unfortunately I wasn't able to add everything I wanted but I did add most of it. The ones I really wanted to add that I didn't were more alerts and having the arrival time thing signify the arrival of a timed event. I did add a fair bit of other improvements though and I am overall happy with the interactive experience I created with my website.
